## Description

_This application has the following functionality:_

* _A user is able to enter an amount (in U.S. dollars) and then specify another currency (such as the South Korean won). The user can then see the total amount they entered in converted currency._
* _Users can convert U.S. currency into five different types of currency._
* _If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application returns a notification to the user (via the DOM) that states what the error is._
* _If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application returns a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist._
